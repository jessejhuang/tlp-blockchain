# Citi Blockchain Project
Hey Baria, Braden and Cory! If we decide on using python, this is a repo we could use. It uses Travis CI, which tests the project's build with each pull request or push to Github. 


### Setup Info
Apologies if this is redundant or unneccesary, but if you haven't worked with virtualenv before, here's all you have to do to get all the repo's dependencies without screwing with your computer:

- pip install virtualenv
- virtualenv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

I've added a simple example test, and you can run all tests on your local machine with the command "pytest".
